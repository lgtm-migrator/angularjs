        <h1>Autocomplete API</h1>
        <hr />
        <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
        <p>Autocomplete, or word completion, is a feature in which an application predicts the rest of a word a user is
          typing. Letâ€™s take a very common example. Whenever you go to <code class="highlighter-rouge">Google</code> and
          start typing, a drop-down appears
          which lists the <code class="highlighter-rouge">suggestions</code>. Those suggestions are related to the query
          and help the user in completing his
          query.</p>

        <h2 id="howitworks">How Autocomplete Works?</h2>
        <p>It helps in navigating or guiding a user by prompting them with likely completions and alternatives to the
          text as they are typing it. It reduces the amount of character a user needs to type before executing any
          search actions, thereby enhancing the search experience of users.</p>
        <h2 id="completion">Completion Suggester</h2>
        <p>Elasticsearch is shipped with an in-house solution called Completion Suggester. It uses an in-memory data
          structure called Finite State Transducer(FST). Elasticsearch stores FST on a per segment basis, which means
          suggestions scale horizontally as more new nodes are added.</p>
        <p>Some of the things to keep in mind when implementing Completion Suggester</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The autosuggest items should have completion types as its field type.</li>
          <li>An input field can have various canonical or alias name for a single term.</li>
          <li>Weights can be defined with each document to control their ranking.</li>
          <li>Storing all the terms in lowercase helps in the case-insensitive match.</li>
          <li>Context suggesters can be enabled to support filtering or boosting by certain criteria.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="config">Autocomplete Configuration</h2>
        <p>To use autocomplete, you need to configure on which filed(s) should autocomplete observe to provide
          suggestions. For this purpose, a few configurations are written in basic javascript pipeline which denotes the
          mentioned keys in Array would be used to retrieve suggestions.</p>
        <p>Though the list is too big to be displayed as sample, here's a optimized set of configuration fields which
          are being used in elasticsearch Wrapper for autocomplete suggestions.</p>

        <h2 id="types">Error Handling</h2>
        <p>A well observed and tested error handling integrated in Wrapper application as every error encountered during
          usage of
          the API will throw an user understandable error output. The error specifying that required Content-Type was
          not passed into the headers during autocomplete API consumption. Required header value to consume this API
          will be Content-Type <code class="highlighter-rouge">application/json</code></p>
